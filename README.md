# Working Through Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics

This repository contains some notes on my progress through [Structure
and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics][sicm]. This book lies at
the intersection of things that matter very much to me: mechanics,
mathematics and computation.

The crew behind this book (and the corresponding code) are a curious
bunch and they have fun exploring their curiosities. They are slowly
becoming my spiritual guides.

These are mostly notes for myself, but it's great if you want to
follow along.

## Background Material

You can buy a physical copy of this book [at its official store
page][sicm], or you can read [a beautiful rendition of the HTML
version online][sicm-html]. There is also an MIT OCW course
corresponding to it:

- [Classical Mechanics: A Computational Approach by Prof. Gerald
  Sussman and Jack Wisdom][cm-course-sussman-wisdom]

The language used in this book and the accompanying library ([Scheme
Mechanics or Scmutils][scmutils]) is called [Scheme][mit-scheme]. If
you are interested in learning about it, the following course (and
[related book][sicp]) is excellent:

-  [Structure And Interpretation Of Computer Programs by Hal Abelson
   and Gerald Jay Sussman][programming-course-abelson-sussman]

In addition to this, the following courses are also really
interesting:

- [Classical Mechanics by Leonard Susskind][cm-course-susskind]
- [Classical Physics by Venkataraman Balakrishnan][physics-course-balakrishnan]
- [Fundamentals of Physics with Ramamurti Shankar][physics-course-shankar]

## Following Along

I happen to work on an Apple Silicon Mac, and part of this repository
is a collection of notes and hacks needed to get [MIT
Scheme][mit-scheme] and [Scmutils][scmutils] working nicely on it. (I
also happen to use [GNU Emacs][gnu-emacs], so there will be some bonus
material on how you can get a nice [REPL][wiki-repl] working in
Emacs.)
